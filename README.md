# PureScript-by-Example-Solutions

My solutions to the exercises in "PureScript by Example" (https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) from Chapter 7 onwards.  Those for Chapters 1-6 are published as [gists](https://gist.github.com/DonaldKellett) instead.

## Incomplete Exercises

*Note to self: I shall return to solve any incomplete exercises listed below once a v0.12.x+ compatible solution is discovered.*

The following exercises have been temporarily excluded from this repo due to my inability to solve them.

- 10.18 Generic JSON Serialization

Furthermore, this repo is a WIP - at the time of writing, I am still at Chapter 10 so exercises beyond this chapter have not been covered yet.

## License

Much of the initial project code for each chapter has already been provided within [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) across multiple code segments throughout each chapter, the condensed form of which can be found in the `exercises/` directory of https://github.com/paf31/purescript-book licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-book/blob/master/exercises/LICENSE).  This makes the solutions presented in this repo a derivative of the code found in that repo.  As required by the MIT License of that original repo, I hereby license all content in this Repo under the MIT License as well.
